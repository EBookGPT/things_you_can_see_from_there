This story is drowning in "telling" and needs a serious overhaul to become truly compelling.  Here's a breakdown of what's wrong and how to fix it:

**1.  Overly Descriptive and "Telling":**  The prose is laden with exposition. We're told about Elara's feelings, her father's love for the sea, the lighthouse's history, etc. This makes the narrative flat and passive.

* **Fix:** Show, don't tell.  Instead of saying "The wind howled like a banshee," describe the wind's effect on the lighthouse, on Elara's hair, on the sound of the waves.  Instead of saying "The lighthouse was a constant reminder of her loss," show her interact with it, maybe she touches the cold stone or avoids a certain room.

**2.  Weak Dialogue:** The dialogue is bland and functional. It doesn't reveal character or advance the plot. 

* **Fix:**  Give the characters distinct voices.  Have them use slang, have them speak in metaphors, have them interrupt each other, have them misunderstand each other.  For example, instead of Elias saying "The sea is a symphony," maybe he says something more poetic or more specific to his experience.

**3.  Uninspired Plot:** The plot is predictable and lacks tension.  We know Elara will overcome her fear and find meaning in the lighthouse.  

* **Fix:**  Introduce conflict. What are the stakes? What challenges does Elara face in her new understanding of the sea? Is there a threat to the lighthouse? Is there a secret about her family that Elias unveils?

**4.  Unclear Setting:** The island feels like a vague backdrop. We don't get a sense of its specific features, its dangers, its beauty. 

* **Fix:**  Show the reader the island.  Describe its cliffs, its vegetation, its wildlife, its weather patterns.  Let the reader feel the wind, smell the salt, hear the waves crashing.

**5.  Passive Protagonist:** Elara feels passive and reactive. She's more a vessel for the story than a driving force.

* **Fix:**  Give Elara agency.  Let her make decisions that affect the plot.  Let her have a specific goal, even if it's just to understand the sea or to find peace. Let her have flaws, fears, and desires.

**Example Rewrites:**

* **Original:**  "The lighthouse was a constant reminder of her loss, its relentless beam a beacon of her father's memory." 
* **Rewrite:**  Elara winced as the lighthouse beam sliced through the fog, momentarily blinding her.  She could almost see her father's face, etched in the flickering light, his smile tinged with sadness.  She averted her gaze, the pain too sharp, too real.

* **Original:**  "Elias brought with him a breath of the mainland, a vibrant energy that she had almost forgotten."
* **Rewrite:**  "You know," Elias said, his hand trailing over the rough bark of a driftwood tree, "I've never seen so many stars.  Back home, you can barely see them through all the city lights." Elara felt a pang of longing, a sudden yearning for something she couldn't quite name.

**Remember:** The goal is to create a story that feels alive, that immerses the reader in the world, that makes them feel what the characters feel. Don't just tell the story, show it. Don't just describe the setting, let the reader experience it. And don't be afraid to be bold and original in your dialogue and plot.
