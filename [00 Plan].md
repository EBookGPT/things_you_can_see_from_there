## Things You Can See From There: Outline

**Chapter 1: The Last of the Lighthouse Keepers**

**Setting:** A remote, windswept island, home to a dilapidated lighthouse. 

**Character:** Elara, a woman in her late 40s, is the last of a long line of lighthouse keepers on the island. She lives a solitary life, haunted by a tragic past and the lingering memory of her father, who died in a storm while trying to save a ship.

**Internal Monologue:** Elara is burdened by a sense of isolation, guilt, and a fear of the sea. She feels invisible, her life a monotonous routine of tending the lighthouse and battling the loneliness. Her only solace is the ancient stories her father told her, tales of forgotten constellations and the mysteries of the ocean.

**Catalyst Event:**  One stormy night, Elara receives a distress call from a small fishing boat, caught in a treacherous storm.  She hesitates, fearing the sea that took her father, but ultimately chooses to risk her own safety to save the crew.

**Chapter 2: The Whispers of the Deep**

**External Events:** Elara rescues the crew, but the experience shatters her self-imposed isolation.  She connects with the fisherman, Elias, who is captivated by her stories of the lighthouse and its history. Elias brings with him a world she has forgotten - the vibrant energy of the mainland, the sounds of laughter, the warmth of community.

**Perspective Shift:** Through Elias, Elara begins to see the sea not as a source of fear but as a force of life.  She starts to question her fear and the stories that have shaped her. 

**The "There":** The island is no longer just a place of isolation, but a gateway to a deeper understanding of the world and its mysteries. Elias introduces her to the wonders of marine life, to the stories hidden beneath the waves, and the stories of the stars that guide ships through the darkness.

**Chapter 3: The Lighthouse's Light**

**Internal Conflict:** Elara grapples with the new perspective she’s gained. Her past lingers, whispering doubts, but the hope and connection she finds with Elias pushes her forward. She begins to see the lighthouse not as a prison but as a beacon of hope, a symbol of her own resilience.

**Growth and Acceptance:**  Elara starts to embrace the sea, no longer fearing its power but acknowledging its beauty and mystery. She rediscovers the stories of her father, not as tales of tragedy, but as tales of courage and resilience. 

**Resolution:** Elara makes a choice to stay on the island, not as a prisoner of her past but as a guardian of the stories she carries. The lighthouse becomes a symbol of her newfound connection to the sea and a testament to her father's legacy. 

**Ending:** Elara continues to tend the lighthouse, her heart filled with a newfound peace. She sees the "there" not as a distant place, but as a perspective that exists within her. The light of the lighthouse shines not just on the sea, but also on the unseen stories that live within her.
